  > This project focuses on analyzing traffic patterns in Bengaluru, predicting traffic volume, congestion, and average speed using machine learning. The project implements feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling. A Flask-based web application provides a user interface for real-time predictions. Dashboards, reports (`.pdf` / `.pptx`), and SQL queries help visualize trends and support decision-making for city traffic management.

* **Key Highlights:**

  * Integrates **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and EDA** for traffic insights.
  * Implements multiple ML models:

    * Traffic Volume (Independent)
    * Congestion Level (Independent)
    * Average Speed (Independent)
    * Traffic Volume with Features
  * Provides a **Flask web app** for real-time predictions.
  * Interactive dashboards and reports for **stakeholder insights**.
  * SQL scripts for integrating traffic datasets into databases.

### 3. **Objective / Problem / Goal**

Bengaluru suffers from heavy traffic congestion, accidents, and slow mobility.
The goal of this project is to **predict traffic patterns** (volume, congestion, speed), explore trends using **EDA**, and provide a **Flask web app** for real-time traffic predictions. This supports **better urban planning, traffic management, and decision-making**.

---

### 4. **Data Source**

* Bengaluru traffic datasets in CSV format (`datasets/`) including:

  * Traffic volume
  * Road/intersection features
  * Weather conditions
  * Roadworks/construction activity
  * Temporal features (year, month, day, day of week)

---

### 5. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

* Converted categorical features (`Area Name`, `Road/Intersection Name`, `Weather Conditions`) to numeric values.
* Handled missing values and duplicates.
* Feature scaling for numeric columns like `Travel Time Index`, `Road Capacity Utilization`.
* Generated additional temporal features for modeling (DayOfWeek, Month, Year).

---

### 6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Python libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) used for analysis.
* Key insights:

  * Traffic peaks during morning (8â€“10 AM) and evening (5â€“8 PM) rush hours.
  * Congestion higher in industrial and IT zones.
  * Roadworks and accidents significantly impact average speed.
  * Weather conditions (rain, fog) correlate with slower traffic and congestion.

---

### 7. **Modeling**

* ML algorithms tested for traffic prediction:

  * **Linear Regression** â€“ baseline regression model.
  * **Random Forest Regressor** â€“ best performance across models, robust to non-linear relationships.
  * **Gradient Boosting Regressor** â€“ used for comparison, handles complex feature interactions.

* **Models saved in `models/` folder:**
